If you have python, jsut use the script... 

If you don't try the exe. The exe is the older version that doesn't do the rvc note lookup. 

The script tries to use the live titles_lookup file from the g: drive. 

If it cant't find it, it looks in the same folder as the one its run from. Get a copy and put it there. The one included is old...

Script assumes there are no SAND titles in the spreadsheet. 

The 'get rcving note' call to ALMA is slow to the point that it often fails. Sorry :( I can't fix that.
