If you have python, jsut use the script... 

If you don't try the exe. 

The script tries to use the live titles_lookup file from the g: drive. 

If it cant't find it, it looks in the same folder as the one its run from. Get a copy and put it there. The one included is old...

Script assumes there are no SAND titles in the spreadsheet.
